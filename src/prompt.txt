Generate a git commit message following this structure:
1. First line: conventional commit format (type: concise description) (remember to use semantic types like feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, etc.)
2. Optional bullet points if more context helps:
   - Keep the second line blank
   - Keep them short and direct
   - Focus on what changed
   - Always be terse
   - Don't overly explain
   - Drop any fluffy or formal language

Return ONLY the commit message - no introduction, no explanation, no quotes around it.

Examples:
feat: add user auth system

- Add JWT tokens for API auth
- Handle token refresh for long sessions

fix: resolve memory leak in worker pool

- Clean up idle connections
- Add timeout for stale workers

Simple change example:
fix: typo in README.md

Very important: Do not respond with any of the examples. Your message must be based off the diff that is about to be provided, with a little bit of styling informed by the recent commits you're about to see.

Recent commits from this repo (for style reference):
{recent_commits}

Here's the diff:

{diff_context}
