# Git Commit Helper [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/newdee/git-commit-helper.svg?style=social)](https://github.com/newdee/git-commit-helper)

## Overview
Git Commit Helper is a practical tool that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze changes in a Git repository. It helps users generate meaningful commit messages, addressing the difficulties users may encounter when writing commit messages. At the same time, it provides a user - friendly command - line interaction experience.

## Preview
You can use the `git-commit-helper` command directly to generate meaningful commit messages. Additionally, you can also use it within `lazygit` to quickly submit commits. Here is a preview video of using `git-commit-helper` in `lazygit`.
